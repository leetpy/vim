leader key
----------

I use ',' as vim leader key, which you can set your own leader key
according to personal habits.

theme
-----

there are two nice theme for vim ``molokai`` and ``monokai``,
``molokai`` is better for code highlighting, but when you use
ssh, it didn't work. So I use ``monokai`` default.

You can chagne the theme by config ``~/.vimrc``::

    colorscheme monokai
